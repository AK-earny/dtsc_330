HW #3
Using heart rate (hr) and motion sensor data (acc_x, acc_y, acc_z) from the first 3 participants, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 87% on predicting sleep vs. wake (is_sleep).
I chose heart rate and motion features because they directly measure physical activity. Heart rate tends to drop during sleep, and motion sensors capture periods of rest or movement, making these features highly informative for distinguishing sleep from wake states. I had trouble trying to get the files to work the way I needed so I had some assistance from AI, apologies for that. Likely couldve figured it out on my own if
I hadn't waied so long.


HW #4 
XGBoost achieved an accuracy of 0.84, while random forest acheived a 0.78, meaning performance of the model by approximately 6 percentage points.
